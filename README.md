### üì° **Project Overview:**
This Flutter app is a simple and minimalist to-do list application that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. The core functionalities include the ability to add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The design of the app is intentionally clean and minimalistic, focusing on usability and a distraction-free user experience.

### üçÅ **Purpose:**
The primary goal of this project was to refresh and enhance my Flutter development skills. During my internship, I was tasked with a challenge involving Flutter, a framework I wasn't familiar with since my experience is primarily in web front-end development. This project served as a hands-on learning opportunity, allowing me to get comfortable with Flutter and its ecosystem by building a functional and visually appealing application from scratch.

- **Dart:** The programming language used in Flutter for writing the app's logic.

### üçé **Learning Outcomes:**
- Gained practical experience with Flutter, enhancing my ability to work with this framework in future projects.
- Improved understanding of mobile app development principles and best practices.
- Bridged the gap between my web front-end skills and mobile development using Flutter.
